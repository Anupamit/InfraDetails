          Mumbai – Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail (MAHSR Bullet Train) project is a
          508.17 km under construction High Speed Rail line that will connect
          Mumbai, Maharashtra with Ahmedabad, Gujarat through 12 stations at an
          estimated cost of Rs. 1.1 lakh crore (US$15 billion).
        </p>
        <p>
          The project is being executed by the National High Speed Rail
          Corporation Ltd. (NHSRCL) through a 50-year ₹88,087 crore (US$12
          billion) loan from Japan at an interest rate of 0.1%, with repayments
          scheduled to start 15 years after the line becomes operational.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first section of Mumbai – Ahmedabad Bullet Train project in
          Gujarat is expected to open in 2026.
        </p>

              Trains on the line will operate at a speed of 320 kmph on an
              elevated viaduct 10-15m above the ground except in Mumbai where
              the line will be built underground using
              <a href="/"> 3 mega Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM).</a> Between
              Mumbai and Thane stations, the line will run under the sea at
              Thane Creek for roughly 2 km.
            </p>
            <p>
              The line’s rolling stock will comprise of Shinkansen E5 trains
              which are capable to running at a maximum speed of 350 kmph (220
              mph) with operational speeds of 320 kmph (200 mph).
            </p>
            <p>
              The project’s foundation stone was laid by the prime ministers of
              India and Japan on September 14, 2017 after which construction
              <a href="/">work commenced</a> for a 4000-employee High-Speed Rail
              Training Institute (HSRTI) in Vadodara. The Indian government set
              a deadline of August 15, 2022, but that will not be met due to
              land acquisition issues (825 hectares required) primarily in the
              state of Maharashtra.
